      "Ruto's political career began in 1992, when he campaigned for Daniel arap Moi's re-election. He subsequently served as an aide to several Kenyan Members of Parliament. In 1997, he was elected to the Kenyan Parliament for the first time.\n",
      "Ruto intended to run for the presidency in 2007 under the Orange Democratic Movement. However, he placed third in the party primaries, receiving 368 votes.\n",
      "Despite the setback, Ruto continued his political involvement. From 2012 onwards, he held various ministerial positions in the Kenyan government. He was elected Deputy President in August and October 2013, and again in 2018.\n",

Neural network pioneers such as Hinton and LeCun in the 80s and 2000s paved the way for generative models. In turn, the deep learning boom of the 2010s fueled major advances in natural language processing (NLP), image and text generation and medical diagnostics through image segmentation, expanding AI capabilities. These advancements are culminating in multimodal AI, which can seemingly do it all—but just as previous advancements have led to multimodal, what might multimodal AI lead to?\\nSince its inception, generative AI (gen AI) has been evolving. Already, we have seen developers such as OpenAI and Meta move away from large models to include smaller and less expensive ones, improving AI models to do the same or more using less. Prompt engineering is changing as models such as ChatGPT get more intelligent and better able to understand the nuances of human language. As LLMs are trained on more specific information, they can provide deep expertise for specialized industries, becoming always-on agents ready to help complete tasks.\\nAI is not a flash-in-the-pan technology. It\\'s not a phase. Over 60 countries have developed national AI strategies to harness AI\\'s benefits while mitigating risks. This means substantial investments in research and development, reviewing and adapting relevant policy standards and regulatory frameworks and ensuring the technology doesn’t decimate the fair labor market and international cooperation.\\nIt is becoming easier for humans and machines to communicate, enabling AI users to accomplish more with greater proficiency. AI is projected to add USD 4.4 trillion\\xa0to the global economy through continued exploration and optimization.\\nThink Newsletter\\nJoin over\\xa0100,000 subscribers\\xa0who receive access to learning hubs, expert insights and industry news on AI,\\xa0security, automation, data and infrastructure—all curated in the Think Newsletter.\\xa0See the IBM Privacy Statement.\\n\\nYour subscription will be delivered in English.

Generative AI models such as GPT-4 have shown immense promise in the short time they\\'ve been available for public consumption, but their limitations have also become well known. As a result, the future of AI is being defined by a shift toward both open source large-scale models for experimentation and the development of smaller, more efficient models to spur ease of use and facilitate a lower cost.\\nInitiatives such as Llama 3.1, an open source AI model with 400 billion parameters and Mistral Large 2, released for research purposes, illustrate the trend of fostering community collaboration in AI projects while maintaining commercial rights. The growing interest in smaller models has led to the creation of models such as the 11 billion parameter mini GPT 4o-mini, which is fast and cost-effective. It won\\'t be long before there\\'s a model suitable for embedding in devices such as smartphones, especially as the cost continues to decrease.\\nThis movement reflects a transition from exclusively large, closed models to more accessible and versatile AI solutions. While smaller models offer affordability and efficiency, there remains a public demand for more powerful AI systems, indicating there will likely be a balanced approach in AI development to attempt to prioritize both scalability and accessibility. These new models deliver greater precision with fewer resources, making them ideal for enterprises needing bespoke content creation or complex problem-solving capabilities.\\nAI has influenced the development of several core technologies. AI plays a pivotal role in advancing computer vision by enabling more accurate image and video analysis, which is essential for technologies such as autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. In natural language processing (NLP), AI enhances the ability of machines to comprehend and generate human language, improving communication interfaces and enabling more sophisticated translation and sentiment analysis tools.\\nAI supercharges predictive and big data analytics by processing and interpreting vast amounts of data to forecast trends and inform decisions. In robotics, the development of more autonomous and adaptable machines simplifies tasks such as assembly, exploration and service delivery. Also, AI-driven innovations on the Internet of Things (IoT) enhance the connectivity and intelligence of devices, leading to smarter homes, cities and industrial systems.\\nGain the knowledge to prioritize AI investments that drive business growth. Get started with our free AI Academy today and lead the future of AI in your organization.\\nHere are some of the advancements in AI that we should see in ten years:\\n\\nThe fledgling field of multimodal AI will be thoroughly tested and refined by 2034. Unimodal AI focuses on a single data type, such as NLP or computer vision. In contrast, multimodal AI more closely resembles how humans communicate by understanding data across visuals, voice, facial expressions and vocal inflections. This technology will integrate text, voice, images, videos and other data to create more intuitive interactions between humans and computer systems. It has the potential to power advanced virtual assistants and chatbots that understand complex queries and can provide bespoke text, visual aids or video tutorials in response.\\nAI will become even more integrated into personal and professional spheres, driven by user-friendly platforms that allow nonexperts to use AI for business, individual tasks, research and creative projects. These platforms, similar to today\\'s website builders, will enable entrepreneurs, educators and small businesses to develop custom AI solutions without requiring deep technical expertise.\\nAPI-driven AI and microservices will allow businesses to integrate advanced AI functions into their existing systems in a modular fashion. This approach will speed up the development of custom applications without requiring extensive AI expertise.\\nFor enterprises, easier model creation means faster innovation cycles, with custom AI tools for every business function. No-code and low-code platforms will allow non-technical users to create AI models by using drag-and-drop components, plug-and-play modules or guided workflows. As many of these platforms will be LLM-based, users can also query up an AI model using prompts.\\nAuto-ML platforms are rapidly improving, automating tasks such as data preprocessing, feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Over the next decade, Auto-ML will become even more user-friendly and accessible, allowing people to create high-performing AI models quickly without specialized expertise. Cloud-based AI services will also provide businesses with prebuilt AI models that can be customized, integrated and scaled as needed.\\nFor hobbyists, accessible AI tools will foster a new wave of individual innovation, allowing them to develop AI applications for personal projects or side businesses.\\nOpen-source development can foster transparency, while careful governance and ethical guidelines might help maintain high-security standards and build trust in AI-driven processes. The culmination of this ease of access might be a fully voice-controlled multimodal virtual assistant capable of creating visual, text, audio or visual assets on demand.\\nThough very speculative, if an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system emerges by 2034, we might see the dawn of AI systems that can autonomously generate, curate and refine their own training datasets, enabling self-improvement and adaptation without human intervention.\\nAs generative AI becomes more centralized within organizations, companies might start to offer \"AI hallucination insurance.\" Despite extensive training, AI models can deliver incorrect or misleading results. These errors often stem from insufficient training data, incorrect assumptions or biases in the training data.\\nSuch insurance would protect financial institutions, the medical industry, the legal industry and others against unexpected, inaccurate or harmful AI outputs. Insurers might cover financial and reputational risks associated with these errors, similar to how they handle financial fraud and data breaches.\\nAI decision-making and prediction modeling will advance to the point where AI systems function as strategic business partners, helping executives make informed decisions and automate complex tasks. These AI systems will integrate real-time data analysis, contextual awareness and personalized insights to offer tailored recommendations, such as financial planning and customer outreach, that align with business goals.\\nImproved NLP allows AI to participate in conversations with leadership, offering advice based on predictive modeling and scenario planning. Businesses will rely on AI to simulate potential outcomes, manage cross-department collaboration and refine strategies based on continuous learning. These AI partners will enable small businesses to scale faster and operate with efficiencies similar to large enterprises.\\nQuantum AI, using the unique properties of qubits, might shatter the limitations of classical AI by solving problems that were previously unsolvable due to computational constraints. Complex material simulations, vast supply chain optimization and exponentially larger datasets might become feasible in real time. This might transform fields of scientific research, where AI will push the boundaries of discovery in physics, biology and climate science by modeling scenarios that would take classical computers millennia to process.\\nA major hurdle in AI advancement has been the enormous time, energy and cost involved in training massive models, such as large language models (LLMs) and neural networks. Current hardware requirements are nearing the limits of conventional computing infrastructure, which is why innovation will focus on enhancing hardware or creating entirely new architectures. Quantum computing offers a promising avenue for AI innovation, as it might drastically reduce the time and resources needed to train and run large AI models.\\nBitnet models use ternary parameters, a base-3 system with 3 digits to represent information. This approach addresses the energy problem by enabling AI to process information more efficiently, relying on multiple states rather than binary data (0s and 1s). This might result in faster computations with less power consumption.\\nY Combinator-backed startups and other companies are investing in specialized silicon hardware tailored for bitnet models, which might dramatically accelerate AI training times and reduce operational costs. This trend suggests that future AI systems will combine quantum computing, bitnet models and specialized hardware to overcome computational limits.\\nAI regulations and ethical standards will have to advance significantly for AI ubiquity to become a reality. Driven by frameworks such as the EU AI Act, a key development will be the creation of rigorous risk management systems, classifying AI into risk tiers and imposing stricter requirements on high-risk AI. AI models, especially generative and large-scale ones, might need to meet transparency, robustness and cybersecurity standards. These frameworks are likely to expand globally, following the EU AI Act, which sets standards for healthcare, finance and critical infrastructure sectors.\\nEthical considerations will shape regulations, including bans on systems that pose unacceptable risks, such as social scoring and remote biometric identification in public spaces. AI systems will be required to include human oversight, protect fundamental rights, address issues such as bias and fairness and guarantee responsible deployment.\\nAI that proactively anticipates needs and makes decisions autonomously will likely become a core part of personal and business life. Agentic AI refers to systems composed of specialized agents that operate independently, each handling specific tasks. These agents interact with data, systems and people to complete multistep workflows, enabling businesses to automate complex processes such as customer support or network diagnostics. Unlike monolithic large language models (LLMs), agentic AI adapts to real-time environments, using simpler decision-making algorithms and feedback loops to learn and improve.\\nA key advantage of agentic AI is its division of labor between the LLM, which handles general tasks and domain-specific agents, which provide deep expertise. This division helps mitigate LLM limitations. For example, in a telecommunications company, an LLM might categorize a customer inquiry, while specialized agents retrieve account information, diagnose issues and formulate a solution in real time.\\nBy 2034, these agentic AI systems might become central to managing everything from business workflows to smart homes. Their ability to autonomously anticipate needs, make decisions and learn from their environment might make them more efficient and cost-effective, complementing the general capabilities of LLMs and increasing AI\\'s accessibility across industries.\\nAs human-generated data becomes scarce, enterprises are already pivoting to synthetic data—artificial datasets that mimic real-world patterns without the same resource limitations or ethical concerns. This approach will become the standard for training AI, enhancing model accuracy while promoting data diversity. AI training data will include satellite imagery, biometric data, audio logs and IoT sensor data.\\nThe rise of customized models will be a key AI trend, with organizations using proprietary datasets to train AI tailored to their specific needs. These models, designed for content generation, customer interaction and process optimization, can outperform general-purpose LLMs by aligning closely with an organization\\'s unique data and context. Companies will invest in data quality assurance so both real and synthetic data meet high standards of reliability, accuracy, and diversity, maintaining AI performance and ethical robustness.\\nThe challenge of \"shadow AI\"—unauthorized AI tools used by employees—will push organizations to implement stricter data governance, guaranteeing that only approved AI systems access sensitive, proprietary data.\\nAs AI continues to evolve, several ambitious \"moonshot\" ideas are emerging to address current limitations and push the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve. One such moonshot is post-Moore computing1, which aims to move beyond traditional von Neumann architecture as GPUs and TPUs near their physical and practical limits.\\nWith AI models becoming increasingly complex and data-intensive, new computing paradigms are needed. Innovations in neuromorphic computing2, which mimics the neural structure of the human brain, are at the forefront of this transition. Also, optical computing3, which uses light instead of electrical signals to process information, offers promising avenues for enhancing computational efficiency and scalability.\\nAnother significant moonshot is the development of a distributed Internet of AI4, or federated AI, which envisions a distributed and decentralized AI infrastructure. Unlike traditional centralized AI models that rely on vast data centers, federated AI operates across multiple devices and locations, processing data locally to enhance privacy and reduce latency.\\nBy enabling smartphones, IoT gadgets and edge computing nodes to collaborate and share insights without transmitting raw data, federated AI fosters a more secure and scalable AI ecosystem. Current research focuses on developing efficient algorithms and protocols for seamless collaboration among distributed models, facilitating real-time learning while maintaining high data integrity and privacy standards.\\nAnother pivotal area of experimentation addresses the inherent limitations of the transformer architecture\\'s attention mechanism5. Transformers rely on an attention mechanism with a context window to process relevant parts of the input data, such as previous tokens in a conversation. However, as the context window expands to incorporate more historical data, the computational complexity increases quadratically, making it inefficient and costly.\\nTo overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring approaches such as linearizing the attention mechanism or introducing more efficient windowing techniques, allowing transformers to handle larger context windows without the exponential increase in computational resources. This advancement would allow AI models to better understand and incorporate extensive past interactions, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant responses.\\nImagine starting your day in 2034. A voice-controlled intelligent assistant, connected to every aspect of your life, greets you with your family meal plan for the week, tailored to everyone’s preferences. It will notify you of the current state of your pantry, ordering groceries when necessary. Your commute becomes automatic as your virtual chauffeur navigates the most efficient route to work, adjusting for traffic and weather in real-time.\\nAt work, an AI partner sifts through daily tasks and provides you with actionable insights, help with routine tasks and acts as a dynamic, proactive knowledge database. On a personal level, AI-embedded technology can craft bespoke entertainment, generating stories, music or visual art customized for your tastes. If you want to learn something, the AI can provide video tutorials tailored to your learning style, integrating text, images and voice.\\nAs AI adoption spreads and the technology evolves, its impact on global operations will be immense. Here are some major implications of advanced AI technology:\\nAI will play a dual role in climate action by simultaneously contributing to rising energy demands and serving as a tool for mitigation. The computational resources required to train and deploy large AI models significantly increase energy consumption, exacerbating carbon emissions if the energy sources are not sustainable. Alternatively, AI can enhance climate initiatives by optimizing energy usage in various sectors, improving climate modeling and predictions and enabling innovative solutions for renewable energy, carbon capture and environmental monitoring.\\nIn manufacturing, AI-powered robots can perform complex assembly tasks with precision, boosting production rates and reducing defects. In healthcare, automated diagnostic tools assist doctors in identifying diseases more accurately and swiftly. AI-driven process automation and machine learning in finance, logistics and customer experience can streamline operations, reduce costs and improve service quality. By handling repetitive tasks, AI allows human workers to focus on strategic and creative endeavors, fostering innovation and productivity.\\nThe rise of AI-driven automation will inevitably lead to job displacement, particularly in industries that rely heavily on repetitive and manual tasks. Roles such as data entry, assembly line work and routine customer service may see significant reductions as machines and algorithms take over these functions. However, it will also create opportunities in AI development, data analysis and cybersecurity. The demand for AI maintenance, oversight and ethical governance skills will grow, providing avenues for workforce reskilling.\\nGen AI has made it easier to create deepfakes—realistic but fake audio, video and images—used to spread false information and manipulate public opinion. This poses challenges for information integrity and media trust. Addressing this requires advanced detection tools, public education and possibly legal measures to hold creators of malicious deepfakes accountable.\\nPeople anthropomorphize AI, forming emotional attachments and complex social dynamics, as seen with the ELIZA Effect6 and other AI companions. Over the next decade, these relationships might become more profound, raising psychological and ethical questions. Society must promote healthy interactions with increasingly human-like machines and help individuals discern genuine human interactions from AI-driven ones.\\nAs AI-generated content dominates the internet—estimated to comprise around 50% of online material—the availability of human-generated data decreases. Researchers predict that by 2026, public data for training large AI models might run out. To address this, the AI community is exploring synthetic data generation and novel data sources, such as IoT devices and simulations, to diversify AI training inputs. These strategies are essential for sustaining AI advancements and ensuring that models remain capable in an increasingly data-saturated digital landscape.\\nAs AI continues to progress and the focus shifts toward more cost-efficient models that enable tailored solutions for individuals and enterprises, trust and security must remain paramount.\\nIBM’s watsonx.ai™ is a portfolio of AI products for developing, deploying and managing AI solutions that align with the current trends toward safer, more accessible and versatile AI tools.\\nWatsonx.ai integrates advanced AI capabilities with the flexibility needed to support businesses across industries, helping ensure they harness the power of AI for real impact and not just to be on trend.

In literature and cinema, androids, sentient machines and other forms of AI sat at the center of many of science fiction\\'s high-water marks -- from Metropolis to I, Robot. In the second half of the last century, scientists and technologists began earnestly attempting to realize AI.\\nAt the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, co-host John McCarthy introduced the phrase artificial intelligence and helped incubate an organized community of AI researchers.\\nOften AI hype outpaced the actual capacities of anything those researchers could create. But in the last moments of the 20th century, significant AI advances started to rattle society at large. When IBM\\'s Deep Blue defeated chess master Gary Kasparov, the game\\'s reigning champion, the event seemed to signal not only a historic and singular defeat in chess history -- the first time that a computer had beaten a top player -- but also that a threshold had been crossed. Thinking machines had left the realm of sci-fi and entered the real world.\\nThe era of\\xa0big data and the exponential growth of computational power in accord with Moore\\'s Law enabled AI to sift through gargantuan amounts of data and learn how to perform tasks that had previously been accomplished exclusively by humans.\\xa0 The coupling of generative AI with large language models to create ChatGPT in 2022, its subsequent iterations and related algorithms, served as a proof of concept that machine learning could produce technologies far more powerful and captivating than earlier chatbots.\\nThis article is part of\\nThe effects of this machine renaissance have permeated society: Voice recognition devices such as Alexa,\\xa0recommendation engines\\xa0like those used by Netflix to suggest which movie you should watch next based on your viewing history, and the modest steps taken by\\xa0driverless cars and other autonomous vehicles are emblematic of a rudimentary stage of 21st century AI. ChatGPT 4, Dall-E, Midjourney and other contemporary generative AI systems are currently disrupting most business sectors. But the next five years of AI development will likely lead to major societal changes that go well beyond what we\\'ve seen to date.\\nSpeed of life. The most obvious change that many people will feel across society is an increase in the tempo of engagements with large institutions. Any organization that engages regularly with large numbers of users -- businesses, government units, nonprofits -- will be compelled to implement AI in the decision-making processes and in their public- and consumer-facing activities. AI will allow these organizations to make most of the decisions much more quickly. As a result, we will all feel life speeding up.\\nBroad efficiency gains. Business enterprises will almost certainly be compelled to integrate and exploit generative AI to improve efficacy, profitability and, most immediately, efficiency. Corporations\\' duty to increase shareholder value and fear of falling behind competitors that integrate and deploy AI more aggressively will make for a virtually irresistible imperative: Fully embrace AI or see your investors turn bearish as peers pull ahead.\\nEnd of privacy. Society will also see its ethical commitments tested by powerful AI systems, especially privacy. AI systems will likely become much more knowledgeable about each of us than we are about ourselves. Our commitment to protecting privacy has already been severely tested by emerging technologies over the last 50 years. As the cost of peering deeply into our personal data drops and more powerful algorithms capable of assessing massive amounts of data become more widespread, we will probably find that it was a technological barrier more than an ethical commitment that led society to enshrine privacy.\\nThicket of AI law. We can also expect the regulatory environment to become much trickier for organizations using AI. Presently all across the planet, governments at every level, local to national to transnational, are seeking to regulate the deployment of AI. In the U.S. alone, we can expect an AI law thicket as city, state and federal government units draft, implement and begin to enforce new AI laws. And the European Union will almost certainly implement its long-awaited AI regulation within the next six to 12 business quarters. The legal complexity of doing business will grow considerably in the next five years as a result. The European Union AI ACT, the world’s first major AI regulatory scheme, cleared a final vote in the spring of 2024, and many observers imagine it will set a standard for clear and effective legal enforcement. But large multinationals are working hard to water down its secure carve-outs and otherwise defang the regulation. In effect, considerable uncertainty defines the AI regulatory arena on both sides of the Atlantic and will probably continue to do so far at least several more years.\\nHuman-AI teaming. Much of society will expect businesses and government to use AI as an augmentation of human intelligence and expertise, or as a partner, to one or more humans working toward a goal, as opposed to using it to displace human workers. One of the effects of artificial intelligence having been born as an idea in century-old science fiction tales is that the tropes of the genre, chief among them dramatic depictions of artificial intelligence as an existential threat to humans, are buried deep in our collective psyche. Human-AI teaming, or keeping humans in any process that is being substantially influenced by artificial intelligence, will be key to managing the resultant fear of AI that permeates society.\\nThe following industries will be affected most by AI:\\nThe notion that AI poses an existential risk to humans has existed almost as long as the concept of AI itself. But in the last two years, as generative AI has become a hot topic of public discussion and debate, fear of AI has taken on newer undertones.\\nArguably the most realistic form of this AI anxiety is a fear of human societies losing control to AI-enabled systems. We can already see this happening voluntarily in use cases such as algorithmic trading in the finance industry. The whole point of such implementations is to exploit the capacities of synthetic minds to operate at speeds that outpace the quickest human brains by many orders of magnitude.\\nHowever, the existential threats that have been posited by Elon Musk, Geoffrey Hinton and other AI pioneers seem at best like science fiction, and much less hopeful than much of the AI fiction created 100 years ago.\\nThe more likely long-term risk of AI anxiety in the present is missed opportunities. To the extent that organizations in this moment might take these claims seriously and underinvest based on those fears, human societies will miss out on significant efficiency gains, potential innovations that flow from human-AI teaming, and possibly even new forms of technological innovation, scientific knowledge production and other modes of societal innovation that powerful AI systems can indirectly catalyze.\\nMichael Bennett is director of educational curriculum and business lead for responsible AI in The Institute for Experiential Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University in Boston.

And as with other breakthrough technologies – fire, steam power, electricity, computing – now it exists, it is only going to continue to evolve and become more capable.\\nHowever, one unique feature of AI is its ability to improve itself. As AI helps create more advanced AI, I believe progress will accelerate in ways that we haven’t previously seen. \\nSo, let\\'s take a look at where this could go. Of course, these are really just ideas rather than predictions, but it’s fun to speculate. So get ready for a trip into the amazing, automated and wonderful (or perhaps not always so wonderful) world of the future.\\nFuturists predict that the evolution of AI will be marked by a number of significant milestones. Each one will represent a giant leap forward in the capabilities of machine intelligence, as well as the challenges and risks it poses. While we can’t be sure exactly when they will happen, this is (maybe) the order in which we can expect them to arrive.\\nAGI stands for artificial general intelligence and refers to machines that are able to apply their knowledge and learning ability to a wide range of tasks. Most AI today is \"narrow\" or \"specialized\" and designed for specific tasks. True generalized AI will have the capacity to think, act and behave far more closely to the way we do across tasks involving creativity and complex problem-solving. \\nThis is about the convergence of quantum physics, which deals with particles at a sub-atomic level, and AI. Quantum computing is in its infancy today but can already complete some computational tasks up to 100 million times faster than “classical” computing. In the future, it will be possible to use it to power AI algorithms, supercharging their ability to process huge datasets and solve complex problems like optimization and cryptography. \\nThis is a hypothetical point in the future where AI surpasses human intelligence and begins to improve itself autonomously and exponentially. The results of this are difficult to predict, as it may have very different ideas about the way it should evolve and the decisions it should make than we do. \\nThe big one is machines that are so sophisticated that they possess self-awareness and experience reality in the same way as humans. Of course, this is highly philosophical, and some believe it will never truly happen or that we won\\'t be able to tell even if it does. Insect brains, after all, are in many ways more complex than the most sophisticated current AI, and we still aren’t sure whether they’re conscious or not. However, if it does, it will open a whole new ethical can of worms for society to deal with. \\nOkay – now we’ve got a rough roadmap in place. Let’s jump into the time machine and take a look at what this could mean for the way we live in the mid-to-distant future.\\nTen Years From Now\\nIn 2034, Tom, a 45-year-old with a family history of heart disease, uses an AI health assistant implanted under his skin to monitor his vital signs and nutrient levels, providing early warnings and personalized health recommendations based on his genetic makeup. At this point in time, healthcare has become more preventative, helping everyone live healthier lives and hugely reducing the societal cost of sickness.\\nTwenty Years From Now\\nIn 2044, Tom’s daughter Maria has just graduated and has begun working as a climate engineer. Her primary task is to mitigate the impact of climate change across the globe, and to do this, she leans heavily on AI technology to monitor, predict and manage environmental conditions. Her work is highly strategic, involving implementing AI solutions and collaborating with other human professionals to identify threats and challenges further into the future. She doesn’t have to worry about the family history of heart disease, as thanks to advances in AI and biotechnology, the genetic fault that plagued her ancestors was identified and corrected before she was born.\\nFifty Years From Now\\nCarlos is a citizen of a sprawling megacity in the year 2074. Everything he does is monitored and analyzed by machines to ensure he’s sticking to the strict rules that have become necessary to both maintain law and order and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. Data from surveillance cameras, online activity feeds and personal tracking devices are used to track our energy use, waste generation and carbon footprint. All of this is analyzed by AI algorithms, which then award good citizens credits that can be spent on rationed food items or travel permits. Bad citizens face having their luxuries and basic freedoms heavily restricted. It’s a dystopian nightmare.\\nSeventy Years From Now\\nWelcome to the post-scarcity economy - the age of plenty. Breakthroughs by self-propagating machine intelligence have solved society\\'s biggest challenges. Aiko, reaching adulthood as we approach the 22nd century, will never know poverty or lack access to food, shelter, and healthcare. Automated manufacturing and 3D printing have drastically reduced the cost of producing all the items we need. AI-managed agriculture ensures no one goes hungry. Most importantly, she will never have to work—robots manage the industry and economy, freeing humans to spend their lives indulging in creative pastimes and leisure pursuits.\\nOne Hundred Years From Now\\nNova is one of the early residents of humanity’s first permanent Martian colony. Intelligent, lifelike robots are a part of everyday life, carrying out physical labor as well as acting as companions and personal assistants. Thanks to her neural interface, Nova has direct access to powerful AI technology that boosts her cognitive abilities, making her far smarter than her ancestors of 100 years prior. She will also live far longer thanks to biotechnology developed by AI researchers, which will significantly extend her lifespan and eliminate almost all the risk of illness. Humans are just starting to reach for the stars - but they already know that they aren’t the only intelligent entities in the universe.  \\nOkay, so obviously, this all possibly bears closer relation to science fiction than a serious attempt at predicting the future. But, as I mentioned back at the start, wouldn’t many of the AI tools we have here in 2024 have seemed pretty sci-fi just a few short years ago? \\nAs we move into the future, one thing I can predict with certainty is that the rapid pace of technology-driven change will break down the barriers between the fictional and the real. Many ideas that seem far-fetched today will likely be mundane reality for our children or grandchildren. After all, as well as entertaining us, isn’t the job of great science fiction to help us think about the ethical and societal challenges that may lie ahead? \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What does the future hold for generative AI?\\n🔗 https://news.mit.edu/2025/what-does-future-hold-generative-ai-0919\\n\\nSuggestions or feedback?\\n\\n    Images for download on the MIT News office website are made available to non-commercial entities, press and the general public under a \\n    Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives license.\\n    You may not alter the images provided, other than to crop them to size.

It is our job to make sure that, as the technology keeps advancing, our collective wisdom keeps pace,” said MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan to kick off this first symposium of the MGAIC, a\\xa0consortium of industry leaders and MIT researchers launched in February to harness the power of generative AI for the good of society.\\nUnderscoring the critical need for this collaborative effort, MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.\\n“Part of MIT’s responsibility is to keep these advances coming for the world. … How can we manage the magic [of generative AI] so that all of us can confidently rely on it for critical applications in the real world?” Kornbluth said.\\nTo keynote speaker Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, the most exciting and significant advances in generative AI will most likely not come from continued improvements or expansions of large language models like Llama, GPT, and Claude. Through training, these enormous generative models learn patterns in huge datasets to produce new outputs.\\nInstead, LuCun and others are working on the development of “world models” that learn the same way an infant does — by seeing and interacting with the world around them through sensory input.\\n“A 4-year-old has seen as much data through vision as the largest LLM. … The world model is going to become the key component of future AI systems,” he said.\\nA robot with this type of world model could learn to complete a new task on its own with no training. LeCun sees world models as the best approach for companies to make robots smart enough to be generally useful in the real world.\\nBut even if future generative AI systems do get smarter and more human-like through the incorporation of world models, LeCun doesn’t worry about robots escaping from human control.\\nScientists and engineers will need to design guardrails to keep future AI systems on track, but as a society, we have already been doing this for millennia by designing rules to align human behavior with the common good, he said.\\n“We are going to have to design these guardrails, but by construction, the system will not be able to escape those guardrails,” LeCun said.\\nKeynote speaker Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, also discussed how generative AI could impact the future of robotics.\\nFor instance, Amazon has already incorporated generative AI technology into many of its warehouses to optimize how robots travel and move material to streamline order processing.\\nHe expects many future innovations will focus on the use of generative AI in collaborative robotics by building machines that allow humans to become more efficient.\\n“GenAI is probably the most impactful technology I have witnessed throughout my whole robotics career,” he said.\\nOther presenters and panelists discussed the impacts of generative AI in businesses, from largescale enterprises like Coca-Cola and Analog Devices to startups like health care AI company Abridge.\\nSeveral MIT faculty members also spoke about their latest research projects, including the use of AI to reduce noise in ecological image data, designing new AI systems that mitigate bias and hallucinations, and enabling LLMs to learn more about the visual world.\\nAfter a day spent exploring new generative AI technology and discussing its implications for the future, MGAIC faculty co-lead Vivek Farias, the Patrick J. McGovern Professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said he hoped attendees left with “a sense of possibility, and urgency to make that possibility real.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrevious item\\nNext item\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office of Communications.\\n'"

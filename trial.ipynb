Neural network pioneers such as Hinton and LeCun in the 80s and 2000s paved the way for generative models. In turn, the deep learning boom of the 2010s fueled major advances in natural language processing (NLP), image and text generation and medical diagnostics through image segmentation, expanding AI capabilities. These advancements are culminating in multimodal AI, which can seemingly do it all—but just as previous advancements have led to multimodal, what might multimodal AI lead to?\\nSince its inception, generative AI (gen AI) has been evolving. Already, we have seen developers such as OpenAI and Meta move away from large models to include smaller and less expensive ones, improving AI models to do the same or more using less. Prompt engineering is changing as models such as ChatGPT get more intelligent and better able to understand the nuances of human language. As LLMs are trained on more specific information, they can provide deep expertise for specialized industries, becoming always-on agents ready to help complete tasks.\\nAI is not a flash-in-the-pan technology. It\\'s not a phase. Over 60 countries have developed national AI strategies to harness AI\\'s benefits while mitigating risks. This means substantial investments in research and development, reviewing and adapting relevant policy standards and regulatory frameworks and ensuring the technology doesn’t decimate the fair labor market and international cooperation.\\nIt is becoming easier for humans and machines to communicate, enabling AI users to accomplish more with greater proficiency. AI is projected to add USD 4.4 trillion\\xa0to the global economy through continued exploration and optimization.\\nThink Newsletter\\nJoin over\\xa0100,000 subscribers\\xa0who receive access to learning hubs, expert insights and industry news on AI,\\xa0security, automation, data and infrastructure—all curated in the Think Newsletter.\\xa0See the IBM Privacy Statement.\\n\\nYour subscription will be delivered in English.

Generative AI models such as GPT-4 have shown immense promise in the short time they\\'ve been available for public consumption, but their limitations have also become well known. As a result, the future of AI is being defined by a shift toward both open source large-scale models for experimentation and the development of smaller, more efficient models to spur ease of use and facilitate a lower cost.\\nInitiatives such as Llama 3.1, an open source AI model with 400 billion parameters and Mistral Large 2, released for research purposes, illustrate the trend of fostering community collaboration in AI projects while maintaining commercial rights. The growing interest in smaller models has led to the creation of models such as the 11 billion parameter mini GPT 4o-mini, which is fast and cost-effective. It won\\'t be long before there\\'s a model suitable for embedding in devices such as smartphones, especially as the cost continues to decrease.\\nThis movement reflects a transition from exclusively large, closed models to more accessible and versatile AI solutions. While smaller models offer affordability and efficiency, there remains a public demand for more powerful AI systems, indicating there will likely be a balanced approach in AI development to attempt to prioritize both scalability and accessibility. These new models deliver greater precision with fewer resources, making them ideal for enterprises needing bespoke content creation or complex problem-solving capabilities.\\nAI has influenced the development of several core technologies. AI plays a pivotal role in advancing computer vision by enabling more accurate image and video analysis, which is essential for technologies such as autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. In natural language processing (NLP), AI enhances the ability of machines to comprehend and generate human language, improving communication interfaces and enabling more sophisticated translation and sentiment analysis tools.\\nAI supercharges predictive and big data analytics by processing and interpreting vast amounts of data to forecast trends and inform decisions. In robotics, the development of more autonomous and adaptable machines simplifies tasks such as assembly, exploration and service delivery. Also, AI-driven innovations on the Internet of Things (IoT) enhance the connectivity and intelligence of devices, leading to smarter homes, cities and industrial systems.\\nGain the knowledge to prioritize AI investments that drive business growth. Get started with our free AI Academy today and lead the future of AI in your organization.\\nHere are some of the advancements in AI that we should see in ten years:\\n\\nThe fledgling field of multimodal AI will be thoroughly tested and refined by 2034. Unimodal AI focuses on a single data type, such as NLP or computer vision. In contrast, multimodal AI more closely resembles how humans communicate by understanding data across visuals, voice, facial expressions and vocal inflections. This technology will integrate text, voice, images, videos and other data to create more intuitive interactions between humans and computer systems. It has the potential to power advanced virtual assistants and chatbots that understand complex queries and can provide bespoke text, visual aids or video tutorials in response.\\nAI will become even more integrated into personal and professional spheres, driven by user-friendly platforms that allow nonexperts to use AI for business, individual tasks, research and creative projects. These platforms, similar to today\\'s website builders, will enable entrepreneurs, educators and small businesses to develop custom AI solutions without requiring deep technical expertise.\\nAPI-driven AI and microservices will allow businesses to integrate advanced AI functions into their existing systems in a modular fashion. This approach will speed up the development of custom applications without requiring extensive AI expertise.\\nFor enterprises, easier model creation means faster innovation cycles, with custom AI tools for every business function. No-code and low-code platforms will allow non-technical users to create AI models by using drag-and-drop components, plug-and-play modules or guided workflows. As many of these platforms will be LLM-based, users can also query up an AI model using prompts.\\nAuto-ML platforms are rapidly improving, automating tasks such as data preprocessing, feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Over the next decade, Auto-ML will become even more user-friendly and accessible, allowing people to create high-performing AI models quickly without specialized expertise. Cloud-based AI services will also provide businesses with prebuilt AI models that can be customized, integrated and scaled as needed.\\nFor hobbyists, accessible AI tools will foster a new wave of individual innovation, allowing them to develop AI applications for personal projects or side businesses.\\nOpen-source development can foster transparency, while careful governance and ethical guidelines might help maintain high-security standards and build trust in AI-driven processes. The culmination of this ease of access might be a fully voice-controlled multimodal virtual assistant capable of creating visual, text, audio or visual assets on demand.\\nThough very speculative, if an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system emerges by 2034, we might see the dawn of AI systems that can autonomously generate, curate and refine their own training datasets, enabling self-improvement and adaptation without human intervention.\\nAs generative AI becomes more centralized within organizations, companies might start to offer \"AI hallucination insurance.\" Despite extensive training, AI models can deliver incorrect or misleading results. These errors often stem from insufficient training data, incorrect assumptions or biases in the training data.\\nSuch insurance would protect financial institutions, the medical industry, the legal industry and others against unexpected, inaccurate or harmful AI outputs. Insurers might cover financial and reputational risks associated with these errors, similar to how they handle financial fraud and data breaches.\\nAI decision-making and prediction modeling will advance to the point where AI systems function as strategic business partners, helping executives make informed decisions and automate complex tasks. These AI systems will integrate real-time data analysis, contextual awareness and personalized insights to offer tailored recommendations, such as financial planning and customer outreach, that align with business goals.\\nImproved NLP allows AI to participate in conversations with leadership, offering advice based on predictive modeling and scenario planning. Businesses will rely on AI to simulate potential outcomes, manage cross-department collaboration and refine strategies based on continuous learning. These AI partners will enable small businesses to scale faster and operate with efficiencies similar to large enterprises.\\nQuantum AI, using the unique properties of qubits, might shatter the limitations of classical AI by solving problems that were previously unsolvable due to computational constraints. Complex material simulations, vast supply chain optimization and exponentially larger datasets might become feasible in real time. This might transform fields of scientific research, where AI will push the boundaries of discovery in physics, biology and climate science by modeling scenarios that would take classical computers millennia to process.\\nA major hurdle in AI advancement has been the enormous time, energy and cost involved in training massive models, such as large language models (LLMs) and neural networks. Current hardware requirements are nearing the limits of conventional computing infrastructure, which is why innovation will focus on enhancing hardware or creating entirely new architectures. Quantum computing offers a promising avenue for AI innovation, as it might drastically reduce the time and resources needed to train and run large AI models.\\nBitnet models use ternary parameters, a base-3 system with 3 digits to represent information. This approach addresses the energy problem by enabling AI to process information more efficiently, relying on multiple states rather than binary data (0s and 1s). This might result in faster computations with less power consumption.\\nY Combinator-backed startups and other companies are investing in specialized silicon hardware tailored for bitnet models, which might dramatically accelerate AI training times and reduce operational costs. This trend suggests that future AI systems will combine quantum computing, bitnet models and specialized hardware to overcome computational limits.\\nAI regulations and ethical standards will have to advance significantly for AI ubiquity to become a reality. Driven by frameworks such as the EU AI Act, a key development will be the creation of rigorous risk management systems, classifying AI into risk tiers and imposing stricter requirements on high-risk AI. AI models, especially generative and large-scale ones, might need to meet transparency, robustness and cybersecurity standards. These frameworks are likely to expand globally, following the EU AI Act, which sets standards for healthcare, finance and critical infrastructure sectors.\\nEthical considerations will shape regulations, including bans on systems that pose unacceptable risks, such as social scoring and remote biometric identification in public spaces. AI systems will be required to include human oversight, protect fundamental rights, address issues such as bias and fairness and guarantee responsible deployment.\\nAI that proactively anticipates needs and makes decisions autonomously will likely become a core part of personal and business life. Agentic AI refers to systems composed of specialized agents that operate independently, each handling specific tasks. These agents interact with data, systems and people to complete multistep workflows, enabling businesses to automate complex processes such as customer support or network diagnostics. Unlike monolithic large language models (LLMs), agentic AI adapts to real-time environments, using simpler decision-making algorithms and feedback loops to learn and improve.\\nA key advantage of agentic AI is its division of labor between the LLM, which handles general tasks and domain-specific agents, which provide deep expertise. This division helps mitigate LLM limitations. For example, in a telecommunications company, an LLM might categorize a customer inquiry, while specialized agents retrieve account information, diagnose issues and formulate a solution in real time.\\nBy 2034, these agentic AI systems might become central to managing everything from business workflows to smart homes. Their ability to autonomously anticipate needs, make decisions and learn from their environment might make them more efficient and cost-effective, complementing the general capabilities of LLMs and increasing AI\\'s accessibility across industries.\\nAs human-generated data becomes scarce, enterprises are already pivoting to synthetic data—artificial datasets that mimic real-world patterns without the same resource limitations or ethical concerns. This approach will become the standard for training AI, enhancing model accuracy while promoting data diversity. AI training data will include satellite imagery, biometric data, audio logs and IoT sensor data.\\nThe rise of customized models will be a key AI trend, with organizations using proprietary datasets to train AI tailored to their specific needs. These models, designed for content generation, customer interaction and process optimization, can outperform general-purpose LLMs by aligning closely with an organization\\'s unique data and context. Companies will invest in data quality assurance so both real and synthetic data meet high standards of reliability, accuracy, and diversity, maintaining AI performance and ethical robustness.\\nThe challenge of \"shadow AI\"—unauthorized AI tools used by employees—will push organizations to implement stricter data governance, guaranteeing that only approved AI systems access sensitive, proprietary data.\\nAs AI continues to evolve, several ambitious \"moonshot\" ideas are emerging to address current limitations and push the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve. One such moonshot is post-Moore computing1, which aims to move beyond traditional von Neumann architecture as GPUs and TPUs near their physical and practical limits.\\nWith AI models becoming increasingly complex and data-intensive, new computing paradigms are needed. Innovations in neuromorphic computing2, which mimics the neural structure of the human brain, are at the forefront of this transition. Also, optical computing3, which uses light instead of electrical signals to process information, offers promising avenues for enhancing computational efficiency and scalability.\\nAnother significant moonshot is the development of a distributed Internet of AI4, or federated AI, which envisions a distributed and decentralized AI infrastructure. Unlike traditional centralized AI models that rely on vast data centers, federated AI operates across multiple devices and locations, processing data locally to enhance privacy and reduce latency.\\nBy enabling smartphones, IoT gadgets and edge computing nodes to collaborate and share insights without transmitting raw data, federated AI fosters a more secure and scalable AI ecosystem. Current research focuses on developing efficient algorithms and protocols for seamless collaboration among distributed models, facilitating real-time learning while maintaining high data integrity and privacy standards.\\nAnother pivotal area of experimentation addresses the inherent limitations of the transformer architecture\\'s attention mechanism5. Transformers rely on an attention mechanism with a context window to process relevant parts of the input data, such as previous tokens in a conversation. However, as the context window expands to incorporate more historical data, the computational complexity increases quadratically, making it inefficient and costly.\\nTo overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring approaches such as linearizing the attention mechanism or introducing more efficient windowing techniques, allowing transformers to handle larger context windows without the exponential increase in computational resources. This advancement would allow AI models to better understand and incorporate extensive past interactions, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant responses.\\nImagine starting your day in 2034. A voice-controlled intelligent assistant, connected to every aspect of your life, greets you with your family meal plan for the week, tailored to everyone’s preferences. It will notify you of the current state of your pantry, ordering groceries when necessary. Your commute becomes automatic as your virtual chauffeur navigates the most efficient route to work, adjusting for traffic and weather in real-time.\\nAt work, an AI partner sifts through daily tasks and provides you with actionable insights, help with routine tasks and acts as a dynamic, proactive knowledge database. On a personal level, AI-embedded technology can craft bespoke entertainment, generating stories, music or visual art customized for your tastes. If you want to learn something, the AI can provide video tutorials tailored to your learning style, integrating text, images and voice.\\nAs AI adoption spreads and the technology evolves, its impact on global operations will be immense. Here are some major implications of advanced AI technology:\\nAI will play a dual role in climate action by simultaneously contributing to rising energy demands and serving as a tool for mitigation. The computational resources required to train and deploy large AI models significantly increase energy consumption, exacerbating carbon emissions if the energy sources are not sustainable. Alternatively, AI can enhance climate initiatives by optimizing energy usage in various sectors, improving climate modeling and predictions and enabling innovative solutions for renewable energy, carbon capture and environmental monitoring.\\nIn manufacturing, AI-powered robots can perform complex assembly tasks with precision, boosting production rates and reducing defects. In healthcare, automated diagnostic tools assist doctors in identifying diseases more accurately and swiftly. AI-driven process automation and machine learning in finance, logistics and customer experience can streamline operations, reduce costs and improve service quality. By handling repetitive tasks, AI allows human workers to focus on strategic and creative endeavors, fostering innovation and productivity.\\nThe rise of AI-driven automation will inevitably lead to job displacement, particularly in industries that rely heavily on repetitive and manual tasks. Roles such as data entry, assembly line work and routine customer service may see significant reductions as machines and algorithms take over these functions. However, it will also create opportunities in AI development, data analysis and cybersecurity. The demand for AI maintenance, oversight and ethical governance skills will grow, providing avenues for workforce reskilling.\\nGen AI has made it easier to create deepfakes—realistic but fake audio, video and images—used to spread false information and manipulate public opinion. This poses challenges for information integrity and media trust. Addressing this requires advanced detection tools, public education and possibly legal measures to hold creators of malicious deepfakes accountable.\\nPeople anthropomorphize AI, forming emotional attachments and complex social dynamics, as seen with the ELIZA Effect6 and other AI companions. Over the next decade, these relationships might become more profound, raising psychological and ethical questions. Society must promote healthy interactions with increasingly human-like machines and help individuals discern genuine human interactions from AI-driven ones.\\nAs AI-generated content dominates the internet—estimated to comprise around 50% of online material—the availability of human-generated data decreases. Researchers predict that by 2026, public data for training large AI models might run out. To address this, the AI community is exploring synthetic data generation and novel data sources, such as IoT devices and simulations, to diversify AI training inputs. These strategies are essential for sustaining AI advancements and ensuring that models remain capable in an increasingly data-saturated digital landscape.\\nAs AI continues to progress and the focus shifts toward more cost-efficient models that enable tailored solutions for individuals and enterprises, trust and security must remain paramount.\\nIBM’s watsonx.ai™ is a portfolio of AI products for developing, deploying and managing AI solutions that align with the current trends toward safer, more accessible and versatile AI tools.\\nWatsonx.ai integrates advanced AI capabilities with the flexibility needed to support businesses across industries, helping ensure they harness the power of AI for real impact and not just to be on trend.

Driving AI ’s potential in organizations | Deloitte Insights Auxo Digital | LinkedIn What is the future of AI (Artificial Intelligence)? | McKinsey What does the future hold for generative AI? - MIT News\\n🔗 https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-future\\n\\n\\n                    The future of AI refers to the evolving role of artificial intelligence in shaping how people live, work and interact with their daily lives — driven by advances in generative AI models, AI automation and ethical AI innovation.\\n                \\nInnovations in the field of artificial intelligence continue to shape the future of humanity across nearly every industry. AI is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, and generative AI has further expanded the possibilities and popularity of AI.\\xa0\\nAs of 2024, about 42 percent of enterprise-scale companies have actively deployed AI in their business. Plus, 92 percent of companies plan to increase their investments in AI technology from 2025 to 2028.\\xa0\\nWith so many changes coming at such a rapid pace, here’s what shifts in AI could mean for various industries and society at large.\\nMore on AICan AI Make Art More Human?\\n\\xa0\\nAI has come a long way since 1952, when the first documented success of an AI computer program was written by Christopher Strachey, whose checkers program completed a whole game on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester. Thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the company’s IBM Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince then, generative AI has spearheaded the latest chapter in AI’s evolution, with OpenAI releasing its first GPT model in 2018. This has culminated in OpenAI developing ChatGPT, leading to a proliferation of tools that can process queries to produce relevant text, audio, images and other types of content.\\nOther companies have followed suit with competing products of their own, including Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude and DeepSeek’s R1 and V3 models, which made headlines in early 2025 for approaching parity with competing models at a fraction of the operational cost.\\nAI has also been used to help sequence RNA for vaccines and model human speech, technologies that rely on model- and algorithm-based machine learning and increasingly focus on perception, reasoning and generalization.\\n\\xa0\\nAI, especially generative AI, has already\\xa0 increased task automation for many businesses, and will likely continue to do so in the future. With the rise of chatbots and digital assistants, companies can rely on AI to handle simple conversations with customers and answer basic queries from employees.\\nAI’s ability to analyze massive amounts of data and convert its findings into convenient visual formats can also accelerate the decision-making process. Company leaders don’t have to spend time parsing through the data themselves, instead using instant insights to make informed decisions.\\n“If [developers] understand what the technology is capable of and they understand the domain very well, they start to make connections and say, ‘Maybe this is an AI problem, maybe that’s an AI problem,’” said Mike Mendelson, a learner experience designer for NVIDIA. “That’s more often the case than, ‘I have a specific problem I want to solve.’”\\xa0\\nBusiness automation has naturally led to fears over job losses. Although AI has made gains in the workplace, it’s had an unequal impact on different industries and professions. For example, repetitive jobs like data entry or processing and customer service are already being automated, but the demand for other jobs like machine learning specialists and information security analysts has risen.\\nWorkers in creative positions are more likely to have their jobs augmented by AI, rather than outright replaced. Whether forcing employees to learn new tools or taking over their roles, AI is set to spur upskilling efforts at both the individual and company level.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“One of the absolute prerequisites for AI to be successful in many [areas] is that we invest tremendously in education to retrain people for new jobs,” said Klara Nahrstedt, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and director of the school’s Coordinated Science Laboratory.\\xa0\\nCompanies require large volumes of data to train the models that power generative AI tools, and this process has come under intense scrutiny. Concerns over companies collecting consumers’ personal data had led the FTC to open an investigation in 2023 into whether OpenAI has negatively impacted consumers through its data collection methods after the company potentially violated European data protection laws.\\xa0\\nIn response, the Biden-Harris administration developed an AI Bill of Rights in October 2023 that listed data privacy as one of its core principles. Although this legislation doesn’t carry much legal weight, it reflects the growing push to prioritize data privacy and compel AI companies to be more transparent and cautious about how they compile training data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAI could shift the perspective on certain legal questions, depending on how generative AI lawsuits continue to unfold. For example, the issue of intellectual property has come to the forefront in light of copyright lawsuits filed against OpenAI and Anthropic by writers, musicians and companies like The New York Times. These lawsuits affect how the U.S. legal system interprets what is private and public property, and a loss could spell major setbacks for OpenAI and its competitors.\\xa0\\nEthical issues that have surfaced in connection to generative AI have placed more pressure on the U.S. government to take a stronger stance. Despite this, the Trump administration’s AI Action Plan unveiled in 2025 emphasizes a largely hands-off approach to AI regulation.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOn a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change and environmental issues. Optimists can view AI as a way to make supply chains more efficient, carrying out predictive maintenance and other procedures to reduce carbon emissions.\\xa0\\nAt the same time, AI could be seen as a key culprit in climate change. The energy and resources required to create and maintain AI models could raise carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent, dealing a devastating blow to any sustainability efforts within tech. Even if AI is applied to climate-conscious technology, the costs of building and training models could leave society in a worse environmental situation than before.\\xa0\\nIn a 2024 essay about the future potential of AI, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei hypothesizes that powerful AI technology could speed up research in the biological sciences as much as tenfold, bringing about a phenomenon he coins “the compressed 21st century,” in which 50 to 100 years of innovation might happen in the span of five to 10 years. This theory builds on the idea that truly revolutionary discoveries are made at a rate of maybe once per year, with the core limitation being a shortage of talented researchers.\\nBy increasing the cognitive power devoted to developing hypotheses and testing them out, Amodei suggests, we might close the time gap between important discoveries like the 25-year delay between CRISPR’s discovery in the ‘80s and its application to gene editing.\\nMore on AI75 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies to Know\\n\\xa0\\nThere’s virtually no major industry that modern AI hasn’t already affected. Here are a few of the industries undergoing the greatest changes as a result of AI.\\xa0\\nManufacturing has been benefiting from AI for years. With AI-enabled robotic arms and other manufacturing bots dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, the industry has adapted well to the powers of AI. These industrial robots typically work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt may seem unlikely, but AI healthcare is already changing the way humans interact with medical providers. Thanks to its big data analysis capabilities, AI helps identify diseases more quickly and accurately, speed up and streamline drug discovery and even monitor patients through virtual nursing assistants.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBanks, insurers and financial institutions leverage AI for a range of applications like detecting fraud, conducting audits and evaluating customers for loans. Traders have also used machine learning’s ability to assess millions of data points at once, so they can quickly gauge risk and make smart investing decisions.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAI in education will change the way humans of all ages learn. AI’s use of machine learning, natural language processing and facial recognition help digitize textbooks, detect plagiarism and gauge the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored. Both presently and in the future, AI tailors the experience of learning to student’s individual needs.\\xa0\\nJournalism is harnessing AI too, and will continue to benefit from it. One example can be seen in The Associated Press’ use of Automated Insights, which produces thousands of earning reports stories per year. But as generative AI writing tools such as ChatGPT enter the market, questions about their use in journalism abound.\\xa0\\nAI in customer service can provide the industry with data-driven tools that bring meaningful insights to both the customer and the provider. AI tools powering the customer service industry come in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants.\\xa0\\nTransportation is one industry that is certainly teed up to be drastically changed by AI. Self-driving cars and AI travel planners are just a couple of facets of how we get from point A to point B that will be influenced by AI. Even though autonomous vehicles are far from perfect, they may one day ferry us from place to place.\\n\\xa0\\nDespite reshaping numerous industries in positive ways, AI still has flaws that leave room for concern. Here are a few potential risks of artificial intelligence.\\xa0\\nBetween 2023 and 2028, 44 percent of workers’ skills will be disrupted. Not all workers will be affected equally — women are more likely than men to be exposed to AI in their jobs. Combine this with the fact that there is a gaping AI skills gap between men and women, and women seem much more susceptible to losing their jobs. If companies don’t have steps in place to upskill their workforces, the proliferation of AI could result in higher unemployment and decreased opportunities for those of marginalized backgrounds to break into tech.\\xa0\\nThe reputation of AI has been tainted with a habit of reflecting the biases of the people who train the algorithmic models. For example, facial recognition technology has been known to favor lighter-skinned individuals, discriminating against people of color with darker complexions. If researchers aren’t careful in rooting out these biases early on, AI tools could reinforce these biases in the minds of users and perpetuate social inequalities.\\xa0\\nThe spread of deepfakes threatens to blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading the general public to question what’s real and what isn’t. And if people are unable to identify deepfakes, the impact of misinformation could be dangerous to individuals and entire countries alike. Deepfakes have been used to promote political propaganda, commit financial fraud and place students in compromising positions, among other use cases.\\xa0\\xa0\\nTraining AI models on public data increases the chances of data security breaches that could expose consumers’ personal information. Companies contribute to these risks by adding their own data as well. A 2024 Cisco survey found that 48 percent of businesses have entered non-public company information into generative AI tools and 69 percent are worried these tools could damage their intellectual property and legal rights. A single breach could expose the information of millions of consumers and leave organizations vulnerable as a result.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe use of AI in automated weapons poses a major threat to countries and their general populations. While automated weapons systems are already deadly, they can also fail to discriminate between soldiers and civilians. Letting artificial intelligence fall into the wrong hands could lead to irresponsible use and the deployment of weapons that put larger groups of people at risk.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNightmare scenarios depict what’s known as the technological singularity, where superintelligent machines take over and permanently alter human existence through intentional harm or eradication. Even if AI systems never reach this level, they can become more complex to the point where it’s difficult to determine how AI makes decisions at times. This can lead to a lack of transparency around how to fix algorithms when mistakes or unintended behaviors occur.\\xa0\\n“I don’t think the methods we use currently in these areas will lead to machines that decide to kill us,” said Marc Gyongyosi, founder of Onetrack.AI. “I think that maybe five or 10 years from now, I’ll have to reevaluate that statement because we’ll have different methods available and different ways to go about these things.”\\n\\xa0\\nHere are a few key milestones in AI history that have shaped what the technology is today — and what it could become in the future.\\nOpenAI launched GPT‑5, introducing enhanced contextual understanding and sharper generative capabilities powered by expanded training data and optimized model architecture. GPT-5 represents yet another leap forward in benchmark-setting performance that broadly influences development across industries.\\xa0\\nThe first global AI Safety Summit convened at Bletchley Park in England, signifying a moment of reckoning for AI’s trajectory in the public and policy arenas. It marked the first time 29 nations — including the United States, China and the European Union — joined forces with a joint declaration on international AI safety cooperation.\\nThis event elevated ethical AI governance into global diplomatic discourse. Hosted at the historic home of wartime codebreaking, the summit symbolized how AI’s future must be shaped with the same urgency and cooperation as past technological milestones.\\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT, a large language model chatbot that quickly garnered massive public attention for its conversational fluency and broad utility — whether aiding with code, writing or research tasks. This launch matters as a significant moment in AI\\'s public adoption, and highlighted initial misconceptions, strengths and limitations of generative models.\\nIn 2017, researchers at Google published “Attention Is All You Need,” which introduced the transformer architecture — a foundational breakthrough enabling AI systems to model long-range dependencies in data more effectively than ever before. This marked a major milestone in AI development, as transformers underpin nearly all modern generative models, including those powering tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude and more.\\nIn 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue became the first computer to defeat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. This mattered because it demonstrated AI’s capacity to master complex, strategic tasks under human-level performance in a high-stakes domain.\\nThe first trainable neural network, known as Perceptron, was demonstrated by Cornell University psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. The Perceptron model was a single-layer neural network with adjustable weights and thresholds placed between input and output layers, mirroring modern neural network designs.\\nIn the summer of 1956, the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence convened, where the term “artificial intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy, alongside key figures like Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester. This workshop laid the symbolic foundation of AI as a formal research discipline.\\nIn 1950, Alan Turing published “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” introducing the concept of the Turing Test — a philosophical and practical measure of machine intelligence — and launching serious debate on whether machines could think.\\nAI is expected to improve industries like healthcare, manufacturing and customer service, leading to higher-quality experiences for both workers and customers. However, it does face challenges like increased regulation, data privacy concerns and worries over job losses.\\nAI is becoming a bigger part of daily life, with generative AI tools already helping people write, code and learn, and AI systems being used to analyze data and assist in research in almost every industry. In the future, AI could also further assist with human care, household tasks and workplace safety — boosting productivity and efficiency across different settings.\\nWhether AI is a threat to humanity depends on how people in control of AI decide to use the technology. If it falls into the wrong hands, AI could be used to expose people’s personal information, spread misinformation and perpetuate social inequalities, among other malicious use cases.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What does the future hold for generative AI? - MIT News\\n🔗 https://news.mit.edu/2025/what-does-future-hold-generative-ai-0919\\n\\nSuggestions or feedback?\\n\\n    Images for download on the MIT News office website are made available to non-commercial entities, press and the general public under a \\n    Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives license.\\n    You may not alter the images provided, other than to crop them to size.

It is our job to make sure that, as the technology keeps advancing, our collective wisdom keeps pace,” said MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan to kick off this first symposium of the MGAIC, a\\xa0consortium of industry leaders and MIT researchers launched in February to harness the power of generative AI for the good of society.\\nUnderscoring the critical need for this collaborative effort, MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.\\n“Part of MIT’s responsibility is to keep these advances coming for the world. … How can we manage the magic [of generative AI] so that all of us can confidently rely on it for critical applications in the real world?” Kornbluth said.\\nTo keynote speaker Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, the most exciting and significant advances in generative AI will most likely not come from continued improvements or expansions of large language models like Llama, GPT, and Claude. Through training, these enormous generative models learn patterns in huge datasets to produce new outputs.\\nInstead, LuCun and others are working on the development of “world models” that learn the same way an infant does — by seeing and interacting with the world around them through sensory input.\\n“A 4-year-old has seen as much data through vision as the largest LLM. … The world model is going to become the key component of future AI systems,” he said.\\nA robot with this type of world model could learn to complete a new task on its own with no training. LeCun sees world models as the best approach for companies to make robots smart enough to be generally useful in the real world.\\nBut even if future generative AI systems do get smarter and more human-like through the incorporation of world models, LeCun doesn’t worry about robots escaping from human control.\\nScientists and engineers will need to design guardrails to keep future AI systems on track, but as a society, we have already been doing this for millennia by designing rules to align human behavior with the common good, he said.\\n“We are going to have to design these guardrails, but by construction, the system will not be able to escape those guardrails,” LeCun said.\\nKeynote speaker Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, also discussed how generative AI could impact the future of robotics.\\nFor instance, Amazon has already incorporated generative AI technology into many of its warehouses to optimize how robots travel and move material to streamline order processing.\\nHe expects many future innovations will focus on the use of generative AI in collaborative robotics by building machines that allow humans to become more efficient.\\n“GenAI is probably the most impactful technology I have witnessed throughout my whole robotics career,” he said.\\nOther presenters and panelists discussed the impacts of generative AI in businesses, from largescale enterprises like Coca-Cola and Analog Devices to startups like health care AI company Abridge.\\nSeveral MIT faculty members also spoke about their latest research projects, including the use of AI to reduce noise in ecological image data, designing new AI systems that mitigate bias and hallucinations, and enabling LLMs to learn more about the visual world.\\nAfter a day spent exploring new generative AI technology and discussing its implications for the future, MGAIC faculty co-lead Vivek Farias, the Patrick J. McGovern Professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said he hoped attendees left with “a sense of possibility, and urgency to make that possibility real.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrevious item\\nNext item\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\n\\nRead full story →\\n            \\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office of Communications.\\n'"
